5.While loop: while loop with 10 example,some example like- count number,print Numbers (reverse,even,sum,squares),reverse a string,print Pattern,find factorial,doubling a number,print characters of a string,etc.

#Day 3:

1.Break statement: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of whether the loop's condition has been satisfied or not. When Python encounters a break statement inside a loop (such as a for or while loop), it immediately exits the loop and continues with the next statement after the loop.The break statement provides a flexible way to control the flow of execution within loops, allowing you to exit them under specific conditions.

2.Pass statement: The pass statement is a null operation. It serves as a placeholder within a block of code where syntactically some code is required, but you don't want to perform any action. It essentially does nothing when executed and is often used as a placeholder for future code implementation or as a way to create empty code blocks that are required by Python's syntax.

3.Continue statement: The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. When Python encounters a continue statement inside a loop (such as a for or while loop), it skips the remaining statements inside the loop's body for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

4.Statistical user define functions: Statistical user-defined functions in Python are custom functions that perform various statistical calculations on data. These functions are designed to analyze numerical data and provide useful statistical information such as mean, variance, standard deviation, median, mode, etc. 

A brief explanation of some statistical user-defined functions in Python:

Mean: Calculates the average value of a dataset by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of values.

Variance: Measures the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean. It calculates the average of the squared differences from the mean.

Standard Deviation: Represents the amount of variation or dispersion in a dataset. It is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of how spread out the values are.

Median: Determines the middle value of a dataset when it is sorted in ascending order. It is resistant to outliers and provides a robust measure of central tendency.

Mode: Identifies the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is useful for identifying the most common observation or value in a dataset.

Range: Represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. 

Sum: Calculates the total sum of all values in a dataset.

Count: Determines the number of elements or observations in a dataset.

Minimum: Identifies the smallest value in a dataset.

Maximum: Identifies the largest value in a dataset.

5.Logical user define functions: Logical user-defined functions evaluate conditions and return boolean values (True or False) based on the outcome of the logic. Logical user-defined functions are widely used in programming to implement conditional logic, decision-making, and filtering operations.

A brief explanation of some common logical user-defined functions in Python:

Even or Odd: A function that determines whether a given number is even or odd. It typically returns True if the number is even and False if it's odd.

Prime Number: A function that checks whether a given number is a prime number. It returns True if the number is prime and False otherwise.

Positive or Negative: A function that determines whether a given number is positive or negative. It returns True if the number is positive and False if it's negative.

Leap Year: A function that checks whether a given year is a leap year according to the leap year rules. It returns True if the year is a leap year and False otherwise.

Pass/Fail: A function that evaluates whether a student's score meets the passing criteria. It returns True if the score is above the passing threshold and False if it's below.

Grade Assignment: A function that assigns grades to student scores based on predefined grading criteria. It returns the grade (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.) corresponding to the score.

Perfect Square: A function that determines whether a given number is a perfect square. It returns True if the number is a perfect square and False otherwise.

Century Year: A function that checks whether a given year is a century year (ending with '00'). It returns True if the year is a century year and False otherwise.
